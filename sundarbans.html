The Sundarbans is a mangrove forest located in the delta region of the Bay of Bengal, spanning across Bangladesh and India. It is the largest mangrove forest in the world and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
<br><br>
The Sundarbans is home to a variety of unique flora and fauna, including the Bengal tiger, saltwater crocodile, Indian python, spotted deer, and numerous bird species. The mangrove ecosystem of the Sundarbans is highly specialized, with trees and plants adapted to grow in the saline conditions of the delta.
<br><br>
The Sundarbans is also an important ecosystem for the livelihoods of local communities, who rely on the forest for fishing, honey collection, and other forest products. However, the region faces significant environmental challenges, including climate change, sea level rise, and human activities such as deforestation and pollution.
